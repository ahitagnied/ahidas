Chōmei catalogs 12th-century disasters: fires, famines, earthquakes, then retreats to a hut. The disasters are vivid but serve only as preamble. The hut life, which should be the core, offers no meditation on solitude or its effects on consciousness. At 2,000 words, it gestures toward impermanence without developing the thought. If you want Buddhist philosophy or hermit wisdom, this isn't it.
