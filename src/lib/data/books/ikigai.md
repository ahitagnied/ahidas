Ikigai locates purpose not in grand callings but in daily rituals: tea with neighbors, morning walks, communal dance. Garcia and Miralles study Okinawan centenarian to show how meaning emerges from consistency, not ambition. Purpose becomes social, not heroic.

The book's weakness is its reluctance to prescribe. "Follow what excites you" is true but insufficient without mechanisms. It describes the state but not the path. Still, the reframing matters: purpose as ember rather than explosion, maintained through small acts rather than singular breakthroughs.
