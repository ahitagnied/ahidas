Tartt builds an insular academic world: Greek rituals, Vermont winters, a tight circle of students who commit murder. The atmosphere is thick, the psychological suspense real. The weakness is indulgence: ornate prose, long introspections, details that slow momentum. The moral unraveling is compelling but could be sharper. Still, the obsession and guilt land. Dark academia as a study in how isolation breeds extremity.
