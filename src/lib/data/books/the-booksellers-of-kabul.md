Seierstad embeds with Sultan Khan's family to map post-Taliban Kabul. The strength is specificity: how daughters resist within constraints, how Khan reconciles old loyalties with new freedoms, how a bookshop becomes contested ground between tradition and change. The personal renders the political legible. Afghanistan's transformation visible in one household's tensions.

The prose stays spare. Details accumulate without ornament, building understanding through accretion. Strong narrative journalism. Empathetic but unsentimental.
