Each time something disappears from the world, the protagonist gains a day of life. The conceit has potential. What would you sacrifice for time? But the execution is unpolished. The prose feels rushed, dialogue simplistic, themes underdeveloped. A few moments of tenderness between owner and cat work, but regret and redemption never deepen. Quick, under 200 pages, forgettable.
