Gibran offers poetic meditations on love, work, freedom. Each chapter self-contained, metaphor-dense, accessible. The fragmentary structure suits contemplation but resists cohesion. No argument develops; wisdom accumulates without resolution. The lyrical depth compensates somewhat, but the lack of progression or closure limits its impact.
