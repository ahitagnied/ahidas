Seven stories of men navigating absence: widowed surgeons, reserved bartenders, all processing loss through memory and silence. Murakami's surrealism stays subtle; the emotional landscape precise. Each protagonist confronts the impossibility of return: places, people, selves all shift imperceptibly. The prose is spare, the affect subdued. Strong on mood, light on event.

"Whether you want to or not. But the place you return to is always slightly different from the place you left. That's the rule. It can never be exactly the same."
