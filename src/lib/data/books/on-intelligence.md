Hawkins argues intelligence is prediction, not pattern matching. The neocortex runs one hierarchical, sparse algorithm everywhere: modeling sequences, anticipating next steps, correcting errors. This theory unifies perception, action, and understanding under a single framework: building and maintaining a temporal world model.

The challenge to modern ML is direct. Scaling transformers isn't the same as building a cortex. Real intelligence requires temporal structure, top-down prediction, sparse composition, and continual learning. Not labeled datasets and static distributions. Even as LLMs improve, the gap remains: they fit patterns, not maintain models that self-correct in real time.

The arguments lack formal rigor and implementation detail, but that's acceptable. A sharp theory that directs inquiry beats scattered heuristics. This provides orientation. Specific enough to test, practical enough to build from.
